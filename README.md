## About
`A collective Essay of Real Character` an experimental attempt to:
* Increase awareness of the wider implications of AI advances and adoption.
* Determine whether AI can enable a truly collective essay.
* Explore whether it's still possible, in 2025, to keep track of the tools used produce content.

## High-Level Methodology
* Staff from Faculty Science Limited, Life Sciences Business Unit, is gathered at a venue on the occasion of the team's away day.
* Staff is divided in four groups, documenting who's assigned to which. A group leader is nominated.
* Each group is given a set of questions to be discussed. Groups 1 and 2 explore the same set of questions (Topic A). Groups 3 and 4 also share questions (Topic B).
* Individuals are encouraged to contribute with thoughts that they consider interesting or novel.
* Each group leader manually takes minutes, and reports back to the wider audience with a summary of the conversation that took place within their group.
* The summary of each group leader is voice recorded.
* The recording is transcribed with a speech-to-text AI model.
* The transcription is fed to a large language model alongside a prompt to write a collective essay on the topics discussed during the exercise.
* Subsequent human edits are documented.

## Participant Consent
* Individuals taking part in the exercise received a briefing explaining its purpose and methodology.
* Individuals were asked for their consent at the beginning of the exercise, and given free option not to take part in it.
