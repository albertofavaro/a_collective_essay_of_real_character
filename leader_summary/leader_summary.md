## Methodology
* Group leaders have 5 minutes to summarise the conversations that took place within their group.
* Summaries are voice recorded with the hardware and software detailed above.
* To capture possible nuances, group leaders are encouraged to report on a conversation item even if this was already mentioned in the summary of another group.
* To take note of attendees, group leaders need to state their name and surname, and the names and surnames of individuals in their group.
