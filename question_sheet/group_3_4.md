## Instructions for Groups
* Each group nominates a leader.
* Each group is given a set of questions to be discussed. Groups 1 and 2 explore the same set of questions (Topic A). Groups 3 and 4 also share questions (Topic B).
* The conversation lasts 20 minutes. Individuals are encouraged to be concise.
* Individuals are encouraged to contribute with thoughts that they consider interesting or novel.
* Group leaders need to keep good minutes of the conversation taking place within each group. They are then required to report back with a summary.
* Conversations taking part within groups are not voice recorded to ensure individuals feel comfortable sharing their ideas.
* Group leaders need to keep track of the tools used to take minutes. If using a computer, they need to note down the specifications of the computer, and the editor. For an example of how to document this information, see above.
* Group leaders need to report to the wider audience with a summary of the conversation that took place within their group.
* The summaries by the group leaders are voice recorded in order to gather documentation for the final Collective Essay of Real Character.
* AI must not be used in this part of the exercise. It was deemed too difficult from a logistics perspective to document how AI would be used within each group. The use of AI is therefore limited to subsequent steps in our methodology.

## Topic B (20 minutes): Are we developing AI, or is it developing us?
Groups: 3 and 4
* Do large language models change how humans think?
* What does it mean for an individual to know something, and are large language models changing this?
* How important is the fact that large language models produce incorrect outputs in relation to our ability to learn from them?
* What long term impact on education, and thus on society, may large language models have?
